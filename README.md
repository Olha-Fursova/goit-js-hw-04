# JavaScript Homework 04 (GoIT Neoversity) – Objects and Object Methods

## Project Overview  
This project is a set of JavaScript exercises from GoIT Neoversity.

The main task is to practice creating and working with objects in JavaScript.
The main tasks of each function are:

**Task 1.** Create a function isEnoughCapacity(products, containerSize) that calculates whether all products will fit in a container. The function must sum up the total number of product items and compare it with the container size.

**Task 2.** Create a function calcAverageCalories(days) that returns the average number of calories consumed per day. The function receives an array of objects describing days of the week and calories consumed.

**Task 3.** Extend the profile object with methods:

- changeUsername(newName) — changes the profile username.

- updatePlayTime(hours) — increases the playTime value.

- getInfo() — returns a formatted string with username and playTime.

## File Structure  
Each task is implemented in a separate file inside the project folder:

2. Click on GitHub Pages link in description to this project.  
3. Open the browser console (DevTools → Console) to see the results of function calls.  

## Conclusions

- Learned to create objects in JavaScript.

- Practiced adding and modifying object properties.

- Implemented iteration over objects.

- Worked with arrays of objects.

- Learned to access object properties inside methods with "this".

- Practiced using spread and rest operators with objects and functions.
